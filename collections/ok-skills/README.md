[![Mentioned in Awesome Codex CLI](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/RoggeOhta/awesome-codex-cli)

Curated AI coding agent skills and `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` playbooks for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Trae, and other `SKILL.md`-compatible tools.

This repo currently bundles **41 reusable skills**: **33 top-level skills** maintained directly in this repo, plus **8 vendored GSAP animation skills** under [`gsap-skills/`](gsap-skills/). Clone it into `~/.agents/skills/ok-skills`; the directories inside already match the layout expected by `AGENTS.md`-driven workflows, and [`CLAUDE_AGENTS.md`](CLAUDE_AGENTS.md) provides a Claude Code-oriented agent playbook.

If you are looking for **Codex skills**, **Claude Code skills**, **Cursor skills**, **OpenClaw skills**, reusable **CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md** playbooks, or practical **SKILL.md** examples, this repository is designed to be both searchable and immediately usable.

**Popular use cases:** docs lookup, browser automation, GitHub Actions debugging, prompt engineering, planning workflows, frontend design, PDF/Word/PPTX/XLSX authoring.

## Who This Repo Is For

- You use Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Trae, or another AI coding agent and want reusable skills instead of ad-hoc prompts.
- You maintain `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `SKILL.md` workflows and want portable instructions that work across projects.
- You need battle-tested skills for docs lookup, browser automation, GitHub workflow, planning, prompt engineering, frontend design, PDFs, Office documents, slide decks, and spreadsheets.

## Start Here

If you only install a few skills first, start with these:

- [planning-with-files](planning-with-files/SKILL.md): file-based planning for complex tasks, research, and long-running work.
- [find-docs](find-docs/SKILL.md): fetch current library docs, API references, and Context7-backed examples.
- [agent-browser](agent-browser/SKILL.md): browser automation for screenshots, forms, scraping, and web QA.
- [gh-fix-ci](gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md): inspect failing GitHub Actions checks and turn logs into a fix plan.

## 1-Minute Quick Start

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cd ~/.agents/skills
git clone https://github.com/mxyhi/ok-skills.git ok-skills
```

After cloning, the repo lives at `~/.agents/skills/ok-skills`, and the directories inside already follow the expected layout:

```text
~/.agents/skills/ok-skills/
  CLAUDE_AGENTS.md
  planning-with-files/
    SKILL.md
  find-docs/
    SKILL.md
  agent-browser/
    SKILL.md
  ...
```

For Claude Code or Codex global instructions, start from [`CLAUDE_AGENTS.md`](CLAUDE_AGENTS.md) and copy or merge it into Claude Code's `CLAUDE.md` or Codex's `AGENTS.md`. It packages a Chinese-first, KISS-oriented workflow with current-doc/source checks, multi-agent preference, `caveman` / `planning-with-files` / `karpathy-guidelines` defaults, strict TypeScript expectations, and context-mode routing rules. Before reusing it, edit the `语言要求` section for your project. The `其他注意项` section is intentionally project-local and can be edited as needed.

Add simple trigger rules to your `AGENTS.md`, or merge the same skill triggers into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`:

```md
## Skills

- planning-with-files: Use for complex tasks, research, or anything that will take 5+ tool calls.
- find-docs: Use when you need current library docs, API references, or Context7-backed examples.
- agent-browser: Use for browser automation, screenshots, scraping, web testing, or form filling.
```

Then ask naturally:

- `Use planning-with-files before refactoring this module.`
- `Use find-docs to fetch the latest docs for this SDK.`
- `Use agent-browser to reproduce this UI bug.`

## Browse Skills by Use Case

### Research & Docs

- [find-docs](find-docs/SKILL.md): focused Context7 CLI workflow for current documentation lookup.

- [get-api-docs](get-api-docs/SKILL.md): fetch current third-party API and SDK documentation before coding.
- [find-skills](find-skills/SKILL.md): discover existing skills when a user asks for a capability.

### Planning & Prompting

- [planning-with-files](planning-with-files/SKILL.md): persistent markdown planning with `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md`.
- [autoresearch](autoresearch/SKILL.md): autonomous goal-directed iteration with explicit goals, metrics, verify loops, and keep/discard gates.
- [diagnose](diagnose/SKILL.md): disciplined diagnosis loop for hard bugs and performance regressions.
- [grill-me](grill-me/SKILL.md): stress-test a plan or design through a focused one-question-at-a-time interview.
- [grill-with-docs](grill-with-docs/SKILL.md): challenge a plan against domain language, `CONTEXT.md`, and ADRs while updating docs inline.
- [improve-codebase-architecture](improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md): find deepening opportunities that improve locality, leverage, testability, and AI navigation.
- [karpathy-guidelines](karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md): behavioral coding guidelines that reduce overcomplication, hidden assumptions, and unverifiable changes.
- [migrate-to-shoehorn](migrate-to-shoehorn/SKILL.md): migrate test `as` assertions to `@total-typescript/shoehorn`.
- [tdd](tdd/SKILL.md): test-first red-green-refactor for features, bugfixes, refactors, and behavior changes.
- [systematic-debugging](systematic-debugging/SKILL.md): investigate root causes methodically before proposing fixes.

### GitHub Workflow

- [gh-address-comments](gh-address-comments/SKILL.md): address review and issue comments on the current PR with `gh`.
- [gh-fix-ci](gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md): inspect failing GitHub Actions checks, summarize logs, and plan fixes.

### Automation & QA

- [agent-browser](agent-browser/SKILL.md): browser automation for navigation, forms, screenshots, and scraping.
- [kimi-webbridge](kimi-webbridge/SKILL.md): control the user's real browser through a local daemon for navigation, forms, screenshots, page reading, and authenticated sessions.
- [browser-trace](browser-trace/SKILL.md): CDP trace capture for browser automation runs, with screenshots, DOM dumps, and per-page buckets.

## Vendored Skill Packs

[`gsap-skills/`](gsap-skills/) contains an animation-focused bundle vendored from [`greensock/gsap-skills`](https://github.com/greensock/gsap-skills) at commit `aed9cfd3277740755f6bfc1155c7aa645403b760`.

It includes:

- `gsap-core`
- `gsap-timeline`
- `gsap-scrolltrigger`
- `gsap-plugins`
- `gsap-utils`
- `gsap-react`
- `gsap-performance`
- `gsap-frameworks`

Attribution and legal files are preserved in [`gsap-skills/NOTICE.md`](gsap-skills/NOTICE.md) and [`gsap-skills/LICENSE`](gsap-skills/LICENSE).

[`planning-with-files/`](planning-with-files/) tracks [`OthmanAdi/planning-with-files/.pi/skills/planning-with-files`](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files/tree/master/.pi/skills/planning-with-files) as its upstream baseline. This repository keeps that upstream directory as the canonical baseline for the local skill. Local differences are limited to keeping the public skill name `planning-with-files` and normalizing `SKILL.md` frontmatter for `skills-ref` compatibility.

## Common Prerequisites

- Some skills assume `gh` is installed and authenticated.
- Browser-focused skills may require a Chrome/CDP-capable environment.
- Third-party doc lookup skills may depend on external CLIs or MCP tools; check each `SKILL.md` for details.

## Full Skill Index

`Source URL` points to the canonical upstream when a skill is vendored/imported; otherwise it points to the skill directory in this repository.

Notes:
- `dogfood` and `electron` come from upstream `skill-data/`, not upstream `skills/`.
- Upstream moved these specialized skills in commit `7c2ff0a2a624e86cec0bcc9cc0835aeff6a2edf0` so installer discovery only finds the bootstrap `agent-browser` skill.
- This repository intentionally keeps them as top-level vendored skills because they are still maintained upstream and remain directly useful.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome for new skills or improvements to existing ones.

1. Keep trigger conditions explicit and testable.
2. Keep examples concise and execution-oriented.
3. If a skill depends on external tools, document that dependency in `SKILL.md`.
4. Update `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` when you add or rename a skill, and refresh the other translated READMEs when the public-facing skill index changes.
